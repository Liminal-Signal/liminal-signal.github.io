# About the project

Liminal Signal is a shared publication space. We publish short essays, reflections, and field notes from across projects.

## How we work

- Each contributor owns a post and updates it as needed.
- Editors review changes through pull requests.
- Questions, feedback, and requests happen in GitHub issues.
