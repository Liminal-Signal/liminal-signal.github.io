# Markdown writing guide

Markdown keeps the writing clean and readable. Use it for headings, lists, and code samples.

## Highlights

- Use headings to structure your argument
- Link to sources with inline references
- Keep code snippets short and labeled

## Action items

- Review your post for consistent headings
- Add one source link
- Use a code block for any technical detail
