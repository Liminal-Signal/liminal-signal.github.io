# Debugging checklist

Debugging is a workflow. Use a checklist to stay focused during labs.

## Highlights

- Reproduce the issue and log the steps
- Check inputs, assumptions, and output types
- Reduce the problem before changing code

## Action items

- Add a debugging note to your weekly post
- Share one tip with a classmate
- Include screenshots or logs when helpful
