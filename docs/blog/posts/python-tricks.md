# Python refreshers

We will use Python for quick scripts and data checks. This is a short refresher.

## Highlights

- Prefer small scripts over long notebooks
- Document assumptions in comments

## Action items

- Install the requirements file
- Run one script from a lab prompt
- Write down any setup issues in your post
