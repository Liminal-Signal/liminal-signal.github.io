# Peer review workflow

Peer review keeps the writing sharp and the code clean. Use a short, consistent workflow.

- Leave specific, actionable comments
- Resolve feedback in a follow-up commit

## Action items

- Review one classmate PR this week
- Summarize feedback in your post
- Tag an editor if a decision is unclear
