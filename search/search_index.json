Similar feelings arose in every revolution that we, as a species, have been through up until now.  It is simply human nature; what a lot of us feel currently watching things become more  autonomous. It happened during the industrial revolution as well. Though, one thing I would like  to point out is that we have also learned to adapt to these revolutions and learned to live with  them. Impact on Society During the Industrial Revolution If we look at the history of our media, it is not hard to see why it would be something we  have learned to fear. Movies like \u2018The Matrix\u2019 and \u2018Eagle-Eye\u2019 show us what happens when  Artificial Intelligence gets way to out of hand. Something that should be kept in mind is the  difference between Artificial Intelligence and Sentience. The AI that we use to automate our  everyday life seems like it has all the elements of intelligence, but it just simply is not. In fact,  the biggest need that should be the point of concentration is the need for some sort of regulation  on it to stop companies from pushing out every automated service they possibly can. Not only is this the main cause of concern for the environment, but also for the type of  information that is being dispersed. Two examples of not having regulations are AWS and IBM;  both companies are leading suppliers of AI-driven technologies AI Chat Builder - Amazon Lex -  AWS. Offering AI chatbots at a commercial level. Promoting convenience while neglecting  information about the impact of water usage and offering another alternative. Something that  could become more common if there isn\u2019t a regulation. </p> <p></p> <p>As we can see in the table above, unregulated AI usage is a problem and it appears that  China\u2019s president Xi Jinping, has been the first to propose a global regulation AI hub in  Shanghai. Without proper regulation of AI, we will continue to see AI fail to live up to its  potential. Even less, if companies just see it as an easy way to minimize costs and maximize  profit.</p> <p></p> <p>A Brief History of Large Language Models - Dataversity Artificial Intelligence uses what  is called a Large Language Model, and has been used by the government since as far back as the  50\u2019s. With the first chatbot around 1966, these models inherited human biases. Meaning that a lot  of the misconceptions that have been developed over humans' existence have also been coded  into these models. This would only go to show just how easily information, and quite frankly AI  in general, could continue to become just another useless tool that ends up being more like the  movie \u2018Idiocracy\u2019. The best and most important thing to prevent a future is that we are overly reliant on AI.  We should be pushing for full support of AI regulation, from all levels of the AI community.  This includes lawmakers; regulation could, in fact, calm a lot of the concerns surrounding the  level to which people are using AI. We should be teaching people how to use AI critically and  learn how to collaborate with technology and information. Instead of trying to use it to further  the gap between classes.  If we consider communities that may not have access to information outside of an  internet connection, AI gives information to those communities. However, the importance should  not be on the abandonment of AI. Instead, the focus of AI should be on making it the best  version possible. According to The Commonwealth Institute\u2019s article \u2018Unequal Opportunities\u2019  students in Virginia\u2019s High Poverty, areas only have access to a third of fully accredited schools  that offer the proper courses. Compared to Low Poverty students where almost all schools are  fully accredited by the state.  </p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s important to remember to also not become overly reliant on it, as this could continue  to push the state of AI further away from what makes it truly a powerful tool. That is, if we can  push for a more regulated form of AI. So that we can teach it, and it can teach us, creating a more  collaborative environment. Connecting information from the world's greatest minds to higher  poverty areas. Eventually, we could use it as a collaboration partner and could even learn to  create a more balanced, unbiased justice system, or a fair, equal health care system.  This would require what is known as Artificial Generative Intelligence. Which would still  be a far-off expectation with the current state. Currently, Artificial Intelligence will only be as  smart and capable as the information that is provided to it. Until then, it is important to  understand how to use AI to teach you rather than having it solve the problem for you. </p>","tags":["profile","contributor"]},{"location":"blog/2026/01/16/ai-hidden-opportunities/#focus","title":"Focus","text":"<p>AI can potentially help close the gap that is seen between high-poverty/low-poverty.

It was the playing surface beneath him. In recent years, NFL fans have watched some of their favorite players suffer non-contact lower-body injuries that have the potential to derail seasons and alter careers. In a league built on speed, jukes, and explosive movement, the ground players stand on matters more than we seem to acknowledge.</p> <p>While injuries are inevitable in professional sports, growing evidence suggests one factor is making them more likely: artificial turf. Research shows that lower-body injuries, especially non-contact injuries like ACL tears and foot injuries occur more frequently on turf. If the league truly prioritizes player safety, it can no longer turn its back on this issue. The decision is clear; the NFL should require all stadiums and practice facilities to use natural grass instead of artificial turf.</p> <p> </p> <p> Figure 1. Comparison of lower-extremity injuries on artificial turf and natural grass. Data from Mack et al., 2024. </p> <p>In 2024 the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine conducted a study that found significantly higher rates of lower-extremity injuries on artificial turf than on natural grass. Notably, non-contact injuries were particularly more common. This is no coincidence. These kinds of injuries reflect measurable biomechanical differences between surfaces.</p> <p>Artificial turf is stiffer than natural grass and creates greater rotational resistance when players plant and cut. If you\u2019ve ever watched a football game, you know that ball carriers and tackler positions are doing this constantly. During these rapid changes of direction, turf often increases the torque placed on the knee and ankle joints. Natural grass, however, allows some give and release where synthetic turf would otherwise cling onto cleats. That added resistance increases ligament stress and raises the risk of injuries like ACL tears.</p> <p>Of course, this issue goes far beyond just keeping the fans happy. NFL players themselves have voiced their dissatisfaction. The NFL Players Association has repeatedly advocated for a league-wide shift to natural grass, arguing that turf is harder on the body and contributes to preventable injuries. When the athletes whose careers depend on their physical health are calling for change, the league should listen. Some players work their entire life just to earn a spot on the practice squad. How agonizing must it feel to have that opportunity taken away by an injury that could\u2019ve been prevented? </p> <p>If player safety isn\u2019t enough to push the needle, we can also take a more economic approach. The NFL strategically markets its biggest stars like franchise quarterbacks, elite wide receivers, and pass rushers. Teams invest in these athletes often to the tune of nine-figure contracts. When a star suffers a season-ending injury, the ripple effects are devastating to their team\u2019s season. Playoff hopes tank, fan engagement plummets, and the overall product suffers. As a result, the financial implications of losing even one key player can far exceed the annual expense of maintaining natural grass.</p> <p>The main argument against a leaguewide switch to natural grass is that artificial turf is more durable and easier to maintain, especially in multi-use stadiums that host other events such as concerts. Additionally, turf performs consistently in harsh weather conditions and does not require the same level of upkeep as grass. These are valid claims, however, convenience should not outweigh player safety, especially concerning a league that generates more than a whopping $20 billion annually. </p> <p>Other prestigious global sports organizations have already taken action to protect their players. FIFA will be requiring all stadiums hosting the 2026 World Cup to use natural grass, even if they currently operate with turf. The NFL is prepared to revert all its effected stadiums back to turf after the World Cup has concluded. As it does so, it will be hard not to wonder, if the world\u2019s grandest sporting event demands natural grass for performance and safety reasons, why doesn\u2019t the NFL? </p> <p>Of course, football is inherently physically demanding and switching to grass will not eliminate injuries entirely. However, reducing entirely preventable risk should be the league\u2019s responsibility. With the data staring executives in the face, every ongoing game and practice without change is a liability. </p> <p>The league often emphasizes its commitment to safety with acts like updating concussion protocols, adding guardian caps, and adjusting rules to protect quarterbacks. Mandating natural grass would align with those efforts. It would show genuine care to player safety and remove doubts about performativity.  Fans deserve to see the best athletes competing at full strength. Players deserve a surface that does not increase their risk of injury. And the NFL, with its abundance of resources, has the power to make this change. The future of the league couldn\u2019t be any clearer. </p>","tags":["notes","reflection"]},{"location":"blog/2026/01/16/beneath-the-game-why-the-nfl-must-replace-turf-with-natural-grass/#works-cited","title":"Works Cited","text":"<p>Bell, Jarrett. \u201cNFL Grass vs. Turf Stadiums: Playing Surface Standards Questioned Ahead of 2026 World Cup.\u201d USA Today, 8 Jan. 2026, https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2026/01/08/nfl-grass-vs-turf-stadiums-playing-surface-standards/87687167007/.</p> <p>Gould, H.

We support solar panels, wind farms, and electric cars. But when nuclear power comes up, the mood often changes. People think of disasters, radiation, or nuclear weapons. I used to feel the same way. Nuclear just sounded risky and outdated. But the more I have learned, the more I think we need to take a second look at it. Especially because of how fast our electricity demand is growing. </p> <p>AI is blowing up right now and every new AI tool, chatbot, and data centers uses a lot of energy. \"15 questions, 10 images, and 3 videos generated by AI can use as much energy as riding an e-bike for 100 miles.\"  We did the math on AI\u2019s energy footprint. Here\u2019s the story you haven\u2019t heard. </p> <p>As AI grows, so does the strain on the grid and that electricity must come from somewhere.  If it comes from fossil fuels, emissions go up, which hurts our climate goals and can raise energy costs. If it comes only from renewables like wind and solar, there can be problems when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Batteries can help this issue, but they aren't always enough for super large-scale, nonstop demand. </p> <p>I believe this is where nuclear warrants more attention. Nuclear energy is one of the few low-carbon sources that can produce large amounts of electricity 24/7. It doesn't depend on the weather or emit carbon during operation. And modern reactors are built with multiple safety systems designed to prevent accidents. </p> <p>But public stigma is still a huge barrier. Many people still associate nuclear power with Chernobyl, Fukushima, or bombs. These fears are understandable, but they don't always reflect the true nature of nuclear power and how much technology and safety standards have improved. Today our reactors are very different from older designs, and safety rules are stricter than ever. </p> <p>Other energy sources also have downsides. Huge wind farms affect landscapes and local climates. Solar needs lots of land and materials. No energy source is perfect, which makes the real question to our problem, which mix of energy sources gives us reliable, low-carbon power?</p> <p>It appears we act like nuclear and renewables must compete, but in reliance they can work together. Renewables can handle variable generation, and nuclear can provide steady baseline power. </p> <p>I am not saying that we should build a bunch of nuclear plants everywhere without thinking. Safety, waste management, and cost all matter. Communities deserve a say in the matter. But rejecting nuclear power completely because of fear or old perceptions could limit our options at a time when we need cleaner energy, not fewer choices. </p> <p>If AI, electric vehicles, and modern technology keep growing at our current pace, the electricity demand will grow with them. Ignoring that reality will not make it go away. Waiting until blackouts or price spikes happen will only make solutions more expensive and rushed. \"Global power demand will continue to grow rapidly over the next decade, jumping about 30% by 2035 as electric vehicles, data centers, and the need to heat and cool buildings increases.\" </p> <p>Global power demand seen surging nearly a third by 2035 For students, voters, and everyday people who care about clean energy, it might be time to update how we think about nuclear technology. We need to look at it as a tool in a larger clean energy tool kit. </p> <p>\"The U.S energy mix today is still dominated by oil and natural gas, which together make up over 70% of domestic energy production.\" U.S. Energy Mix iea.org . The future grid will probably need a mix of wind, solar, hydro, good storage, and nuclear power.
